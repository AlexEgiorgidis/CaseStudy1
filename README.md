Make sure you update the launch.json to point to your environment!
I have created multiple fields with the same purpose, please check which is suitable for you.
Please check the FactBox in the Sales Order Card. The info you're after, it's there, see attached screenshot "Screenshot 2024-07-26 063919.png".
If you publish the extension from VSCode, you might not see the field in the XML Mapping inside Word the first time.
    Known issue, try again...and again...and again. At some point (after 3-4 tries) you'll see it. 
    If not let me know and I can show you a different approach.
